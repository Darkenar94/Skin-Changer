# WHAT IS THIS PROGRAM?
<ins>This program was created specifically for users who use</ins> [Minimal Dark for Steam theme](https://steambrew.app/theme?id=F4XgbtTW4x5CJmi5DUK3) created by SaiyajinK uploaded to the [steambrew.app](https://steambrew.app/themes) and [github](https://github.com/SaiyajinK/Minimal-Dark-for-Steam/)  website which modifies the steam skin thanks to [Millennium](https://steambrew.app) after the 2023 update that removed Steam customization. The skin in question is the best on the market but every time an update appears it is removed forcing the user to have to edit the `config.css` and `webkit.css` files or to have to move the backup of these files to the skin folder every time that this happens <ins>this program is not and does not want to be part of the skin creator's project</ins> (SaiyajinK)
# WHAT IS THIS PROGRAM FOR?
To prevent the user to have to edit the `config.css` and `webkit.css` files or to have to move the backup of these files to the skin folder every time there is an update.
# HOW DOES IT WORK?
- Create a folder inside the `Documents` folder with the name `skin`
- Go to the skin path ...\Steam\steamui\skins\Minimal-Dark-for-Steam-root
- edit the `config.css` and `webkit.css` files if you need to customize the skin
- Copy the `config.css` and `webkit.css` files 
- Paste them into the `skins` folder
- Start the program every time the skin is removed

<ins>Your skin will stay forever, enjoy!</ins>
